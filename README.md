# 2D-Duck-Hunt-Game
Duck Hunt Game written in C++, using the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL).

Press SPACE to start the game. A duck will appear and fly around. The purpose is to fill the points bar by shooting the duck (clicking on the duck).
If the duck is displayed for too many seconds, it will escape and the number of lives will be decreased by one. Same thing happens if the player
misses the duck 3 times. Every time a duck escapes or is shot by the player, a new duck appears.

The game stops when either the player fills the points bar or the number of lives gets to zero.
